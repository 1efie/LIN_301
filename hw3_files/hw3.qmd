Loading the file:

```{python}
with open("./shakespeare.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    text = f.read()
```

Making a list:

```{python}
text.split()[:1000]
first_words = text.split()[:1000]
```

```{python}
first_words[499]
```

Narrowing down the list:

```{python}
chosen_ones = ['thee', 'she', 'beguile', 'now', 'that', 'flowers', 'bounteous', 'if', 'do', 'all-eating']
```

Making a dictionary:

```{python}
text.split()
bill = text.split()
```

```{python}
bill.count('thee')
bill.count('she')
bill.count('beguile')
bill.count('now')
bill.count('that')
bill.count('flowers')
bill.count('bounteous')
bill.count('if')
bill.count('do')
bill.count('all-eating')
```

```{python}
word_counts = {word: bill.count(word) for word in chosen_ones}
print (word_counts)
```

Reflection:

-   The easiest part of this assignment was creating all the variables since that feels very straightforward for me.

-   The hardest part of this assignment was the dictionary section just because I feel like we didn't spend a lot of time going over it in class, so I had to go back and reference the slides many times.

-   A linguist might use lists and dictionaries to analyze text, for instance, to count how many times a particular word is used by a speaker or character.

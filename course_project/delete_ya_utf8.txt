Red-eye, last minute flight
I get in early, I was roused by the light
Back in the city, no longer my home
Trying to let it go
I take a walk in Hollywood
My old apartment isn't looking too good
Then there's a lyric that, in context, stings
The immediate pain it brings
That song that you used to sing

And now I'm back on your couch, frozen peas to my head
Driving up to your folks, cramming into your bed
You picked me up every time, drove me back to our home
It doesn't leave you alone

Oh God, I wish I could delete ya
'Cause nothin' can compete with ya
I replenish and repeat ya
A heart excretes only one of us, only one

Blue and gold Friday night
Team up with Charlie, take these kids for a ride
Why's my heart pounding, beating out of my chest?
Remember to try and forget
I'm locked, she's the key
I'm a boat that's sinking, guess who's the sea
It's hard to shake it off and get back to me
When anything is a memory
And you repeat to the nth degree

And now I'm back in my truck, I'm driving up to our place
We're sitting dead on the ground, there's nothing more to be said
You kept it tight to the chest at someone else's expense
That doesn't sound like real love

Oh God, I wish I could delete ya
'Cause nothin' can compete with ya
I replenish and repeat ya
I'd replenish and repeat ya

I wanna know (Just two weeks, how'd you cut it like that?)
Maybe you show me how (I'm built different, I don't work like that, huh)
I got to repeat, chew up, spit out
The blame complex in me, me, me

Oh God, I wish I could delete ya
'Cause nothin' can compete with ya
I'd replenish and repeat ya
One heart could beat for the two of us, two of us, two of us, oh-oh-oh
Oh, God, I wish I could release ya
Wind it back and never be with ya
Then I'd be happy just to meet ya (Oh my God)
One heart could bleed for the future us
If we were young, but this is done

Lately I feel like I've been losing my mind
I'm acting funny, I keep refilling my wine
I fail to notice when I blew past my limit
And then I lied about it, said I didn't
I'm writing words that didn't come to my head
I'm pushing pennies in my paperback instead
When someone calls me I'm most likely to ignore, 'cause
Recall that limit that I missed before

She's moving faster now
Faster than sound itself
Yeah, she's got me slipping when I told her what was on my mind
That she's mysterious

I caught a current and I'm floatin' away
I feel it right behind my mind, my head, my brain
Is that my tears or is it right behind my eyes?
Sooner or later, will I realize?
Fake aggravation is your way to be seen
You summon every single muscle on the team
You need attention, well, baby, there's the line
Signed, sealed, delivered, plus my overtime

She's moving faster now
Faster than sound itself
Yeah, she's got me slipping when I told her what is on my mind
That she's mysterious (Mysterious and now I know it)
She's moving faster now (She's moving faster now)
Faster than sound itself (Faster than sound itself)
Well, she's got me slipping when I don't know what is on my mind
That she's mysterious (Mysterious and now I know it)

(Do you care?)
(Do you care?)
(Do you care? Not at all)
Do you (Not at all) care? (No, not at all)
Do you (Not at all) care? (Not at all)
Do you (Not at all) care? (No, not at all)
Do you (Not at all) care? (Not at all)
You know, I really don't care (Do you care? Not at all)
I got the feeling right here (No, not at all Do you care?)
You know I really don't care (Not at all)
You know I really don't care (Not at all; Do you care? Not at all)
I got those feelings right here (No, not at all)
The safe way we appear (Do you care? Not at all)
Oh, baby, now, that's alright (Not at all)
You know I really don't care (Do you care? Not at all)
I got the feelings right here (No, not at all; Do you care?)

I knew a girl
She knocked at my door
Head in the clouds
Feet off the floor
I knew a girl
She brought me life
Back when the girl was mine
Da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da
Da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da-da

She knocks and knocks (Ah)
I knew a girl
She brought me life
Back when the girl was mine

It feels like a big waste of time
I don't seem to mind (Oh, ooh-woah)
Why? (oh, ooh-woah)

But life keeps swallowing
That's why I learned to cook (Ah, *burp*)

(Houston)
I'm a vacuum-sealed body bag
In a crafted metabolic way
Salutations to the old world
Hundred oysters for a single pearl
Yeah, life is da da da
This is Purgatory Silverstar
Only me, myself, and radio
Deep space, dеad weight
Body-breaking lonelinеss
It's the end!
So bye-bye blue
In my dreams
I'm back on you

I took it for granted
All that you do
Coming up empty-handed
In a patchwork of truth
So, for the rest of my life, I'll pay my dues
I'll pay my dues
I'll pay my dues

I took it for granted
All that you do
Comin' up empty-handed
In a patchwork of truth
For the rest of my life, I'll pay my dues
I'll pay my dues
I'll pay my dues

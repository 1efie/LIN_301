I fight the urge to search my name
There's a better me, I swear
But curiosity

I see
I let my ego get the best of me
In the age of excess, less may be best for me

God, it makes me sad
We're the last to know
The world is changin' and upgradin'
Faster than we can control

Sick of living in the old days?
Mind burdened by the old ways?
Keep trying to forget about it?

Watch a video, don't fret about it (No)
You don't need it, why you want it? (Want it)
I don't see you moving on, kid (On, kid)
I don't see you moving on, kid
No, I don't see you moving on

Now I see
I let these people dig their hooks in me

And I consider myself a fool
Plugged in, half life
God, you're a fool

You think these people really care for you?
You really think they will be there for you?

Plugged in, that's a half life

I know you, I love you
I want you, I need you
You complete me, (You complete me) I adore you (I adore you)
I adore you, (I adore you) I adore you (I adore you)
I adore you, I adore you
